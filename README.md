# Credit Risk Model for Mortgage Lending

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and analyzing credit risk models for mortgage loans, with a particular emphasis on evaluating the impact of the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on mortgage loan defaults and loss rates. Using machine learning techniques, the models estimate the Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) with explanatory variables such as FICO score, Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, and loan age, incorporating the economic factors that contributed to the financial crisis.

## Objective
- To evaluate how the 2007-2008 GFC affected mortgage lending, financial stability, and risk management.
- To build robust models that estimate PD and LGD based on various economic factors.
- To calculate expected losses, Basel capital requirements, and analyze model performance using machine learning techniques.

## Files Included
- **credit_risk_model.py**: Python code for building and training the credit risk models.
- **credit_risk_model_QA.txt**: Answers to project-related questions, including insights and analysis of the models and results.
- **README.md**: Project documentation, providing an overview, instructions, and details of the analysis.
